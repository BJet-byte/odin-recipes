        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Canned chili is a great easy-prep meal for the lazy Odinite (or at least the non-vegetarian lazy Odinite). It's relatively tasty, quite filling, and a decent source of protein and iron.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>~15 oz. canned chili (brand of your choice)</li>
            <li>can-opener (some cans come with this built in)</li>
            <li>spoon</li>
            <li>bowl (optional)</li>
            <li>microwave (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Procure the ingredients, especially the canned chili.</li>
            <li>Open the can.</li>
            <li>For bonus lazy-points, eat the chili directly from the can with a spoon at room temperature. Otherwise, for normal laziness, skip to the next step.</li>
            <li>Pour the chili into the bowl, using the spoon to get it all out of the can.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl of chili into the microwave (DO NOT include the can or spoon, as putting out fires is not very lazy).</li>
            <li>Heat the chili in the microwave for 1 minute or to desired temperature.</li>
            <li>Remove bowl of chili from the microwave.</li>
            <li>Eat the chili from the bowl using the spoon.</li>
        </ol>
